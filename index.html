"Fetch asynchronously data from an API".
Your task is to write a script/app which gathers data from two endpoints asynchronously and merges the response later on.
For example you could use these two endpoints:
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1 to obtain a user's data
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?userId=1 to obtain all comments written by that user
        </pre>
        </body>
